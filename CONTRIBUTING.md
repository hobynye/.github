## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community 
understand your issue, reproduce it, and find related issues.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you 
don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please 
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md),
the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and 
include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a cursory search** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add 
a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue provide the following 
information by filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining 
how you started the application, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you opened the application otherwise. 
When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end 
of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an application command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, 
which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use 
[Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and 
[this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that the application crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. 
Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), 
a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a 
[gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and 
share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most 
recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions 
it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version are you using?** 
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to 
existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related
suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find
out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please 
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), 
including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing 
issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide
the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as 
[Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of the application which 
the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and 
[this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
* **List some other applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version you're using.**.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [good first issue]- issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [help wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact
a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible product
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) 
are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that 
the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is 
unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will 
open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete 
additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
